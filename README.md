# Yellow-Bot
A discord bot project ongoing by me. 
And, can be useful at sometimes idk.

# What the heck is this?
Ok ok. It is a JDA-created bot which means Java (obviously.)
I suck at javascript. But, i am good at Java.
Sooooo, i am making this bot for useful stuff.

# Who made this?
Me. Now, don't judge my coding. I call myself good at Java but i just learned this language like a month ago.
Literally, 1 month. That's it. And, i learn this everyday so keep up with me. Java is easy to understand idk why.
For me, and FOR ME. Python is hard. Like, making something is hard. They say that python is for beginners but for me it is not.
Hold on, hold on. Why're we off topic? Ok, i am just gonna put--

# Off-Topic
-- this here. Oh, here we are. So, python is dang hard for me. But i made a few things with it like the dvd player sort of thing.
Making GUIs in python is hard af. While in Java, it's more easy. Like, just make a new JFrame(String shit) and add some parts to it
like JLabels, JButtons and other crap. So yeah, i just learned Java for only ONE momth and i am aiming at 1 year to see if im good to it
or no... My coding is garbage so dont judge me :) Please understand. But anyways, enough of this idk? off topic-ness? Whatever,
this is the source code of my ongoing Discord JDA Project called Yellow. So that if i delete my files, i still have backups but BYE see ya
